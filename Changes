    Documentation fixes. [Kevin Johnson]

0.4 Fri Dec 23 2016
    If a table had columns added and removed in prior migrations, the order
    metadata in the SQL::Translator::Schema representation could end up with
    gaps.  This would result in the auto-order code in sqlt failing.  We set our
    own order in AddField now to work around.

0.3 Thu Dec 01 2016
    Fix bug where initial migrations would fail under postgres.

0.2 Fri Sep 23 2016
    Preliminary support for views (PostgresQL only).

0.1 Fri Aug 26 2016
    Initial Release.
